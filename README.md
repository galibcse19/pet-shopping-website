# 5 key features of the project -

1) User-Friendly Interface:The website will have an intuitive and responsive design, allowing users to easily navigate through different product categories, search for items, and manage their accounts on both desktop and mobile devices.

2) Dynamic Pet Listings: Users can view different types of pets (cats, dogs, birds, rabbits) by clicking category buttons. The application fetches and displays pet data dynamically from the API, allowing for a seamless browsing experience.

3) Adoption Modal: When a user clicks on the "Adopt" button for a specific pet, a modal pops up displaying detailed information about the pet, including its name, breed, gender, date of birth, vaccinated status, price, and a description. This feature enhances user engagement and provides necessary details before adoption.

4) Responsive Design: The layout adjusts seamlessly across different screen sizes (using Tailwind CSS), ensuring that the application is mobile-friendly and accessible on various devices. This enhances usability and makes the application visually appealing.

5) Like Functionality: Users can "like" pets by clicking a button, which adds the pet's image to a dedicated section. This feature allows users to keep track of their favorite pets while browsing.

6) Sorting and Filtering Options:Implement sorting options (e.g., by price, age, or breed) and filtering capabilities to help users narrow down their search results according to their preferences.

# ES6 features used -

2) Template Literals: Multi-line strings and string interpolation using backticks (`).
3) Destructuring Assignment: Unpacking values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.
4) Rest and Spread Operators: The rest operator (...) collects arguments into an array, while the spread operator spreads elements of an array or object.
5) Promises: Simplified handling of asynchronous operations.
